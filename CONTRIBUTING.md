Contributing to Silhouette Pastebin
===================================


How to contribute
-----------------

Silhouette Pastebin is an integral part of the [Silhouette](http://silhouette.mohiva.com/) open source project. Contributions are appreciated.

See the current [list of contributors](https://github.com/mohiva/play-silhouette-pastebin/graphs/contributors) and join them!

Some ways in which you can contribute are: reporting errors, improving documentation, adding examples, adding support for more services, fixing bugs, suggesting new features, adding test cases, translating messages, and whatever else you can think of that may be helpful. If in doubt, just ask.


Workflow
--------

Development is coordinated via [GitHub](https://github.com/mohiva/play-silhouette-pastebin). Ideas for improvements are discussed using [issues](https://github.com/mohiva/play-silhouette-pastebin/issues).

For a more streamlined experience for all people involved, we encourage contributors to follow the practices described at [GitHub workflow for submitting pull requests](https://www.openshift.com/wiki/github-workflow-for-submitting-pull-requests).

Scala source code should follow the conventions documented in the [Scala Style Guide](http://docs.scala-lang.org/style/). Additionally, acronyms should be capitalized. To have your code automatically reformatted, run this command before committing your changes:

    scripts/reformat

After submitting your pull request, please [watch the result](https://travis-ci.org/mohiva/play-silhouette-pastebin/pull_requests) of the automated Travis CI build and correct any reported errors or inconsistencies.
